# Quantum Teleportation

Quantum Teleportation is the process by which an arbitrary quantum state can be transferred from one location to another by using two other qubits. Using the concepts of entanglement and Bell measurement we can teleport a quantum state from the qubit of person A (Alice) to the qubit of person B (Bob). The quantum state with Alice is destroyed in the process following the no-cloning theorem.
